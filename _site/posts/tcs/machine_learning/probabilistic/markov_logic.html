  <div class="blog-main">
    <h2 id="markov-logic-questions">Markov logic: Questions</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider a statement like Moral(x) <span class="math inline">\(\implies\)</span> Happy(x). Consider 2 worlds: one where most people are moral, and all but 5 moral people are happy, another where only 5 people are moral, and they are all unhappy. It seems in the Markov model they would have the same weight, when the statement is represented as <span class="math inline">\(\neg\text{Moral}(x) \wedge \text{Happy}(x)\)</span>. Do we want this? I’m guessing this is easier than only restricting to moral people, because that involves dividing.</li>
<li>I don’t understand the terminology used in LazySAT. My understanding of <code>active_atoms</code> is that we take every clause that is not satisfied and add ALL of its atoms. (Ex. if we have a formula <span class="math inline">\(Friend(A,B)\implies Happy(A) \wedge Happy(B)\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\text{Friend}(x,y) \wedge \neg \text{Happy}(x)\wedge \text{Happy}(y)\)</span>, then both <span class="math inline">\(x,y\)</span> are considered active atoms.)
<ul>
<li>But then choosing unsatisfied <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(v_f\sim c\)</span>, it’salways true that <span class="math inline">\(v\in\)</span> active atoms, whereas in Algorithm 2, they consider when <span class="math inline">\(v\nin\)</span> active atoms!</li>
<li>Note DeltaCost can be easily calculated. Local flipping doesn’t require recalculation of the whole cost.</li>
<li>Shouldn’t DeltaCost be a function of a setting of variables, not a variable? Or is it like the derivative in the direction of variable <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span>, i.e., what you’d get by flipping <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span>? But you may need to flip two variables in a clause at the same time to get something better!</li>
</ul></li>
<li>I don’t understand the explanation on p. 8: The initial active atoms are all those appearing in clauses that are unsatisfied if only the atoms in the database are true, and all others are false.</li>
<li>More fundamentally, I don’t understand what the database is!</li>
<li>At each step, take a random unsatisfied clause. Maintain a set of active atoms.
<ul>
<li>With probability <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> choose a random variable from the clause.</li>
<li>Otherwise, choose the non-active variable <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> is lowest DeltaCost. (Why do we ignore active atoms? Isn’t it true that flipping them can also decrease the cost?)</li>
<li>Add the chosen variable <span class="math inline">\(v_f\)</span> to <code>active_atoms</code> and add activated clauses. Flip <span class="math inline">\(v_f\)</span>.</li>
<li>(Do we not want variables to be flipped twice?)</li>
<li>NO: we choose the variable (active OR non-acive) in <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> with lowest DeltaCost. It’s merely saying that we have to do a more involved computation if the variable is non-active. (Why? This has something to do with the DB vs. KB, no comprendo.)</li>
<li>At the beginning, only include active atoms/clauses. Think of these as the dangerous atoms—flipping them could make a clause not satisfied. These clauses are the only clauses we will need to worry about. Add clauses to the active set only if we need to worry about them.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>So what’s the difference between SAT and LazySAT? I think it’s just: are you summing over all possible instantiations (unnecessary!), or just looking at the differences when you flip a variable? You can ignore formulas that don’t invove the current variable.</li>
</ul>
<p>(OK to have some kind of “complexity measure” of formulae saying how amenable they are to random-walk methods?)</p>
<ul>
<li>Intuition about deterministic vs. non-deterministic dependencies. (Tradeoff between search and following stochasticity cf. gradient? The smaller the weights the easier the flow but the lower the probability is to find a satisfying instance?)</li>
<li>MC-SAT has hard satisfiability. Look at all clauses satisfied in the last step; the larger the weight, the more likely you are to force it to be satisfied next step. It calls on a uniform SAT solver (which doesn’t really exist—but there are things that do well in practice).</li>
<li>p. 12. Indistinguishable objects. What if you’re just strying to find a distribution that’s close, ex. for at most binary relations, look at the proportion of <span class="math inline">\(\{a,b\}\)</span> with values of <span class="math inline">\(u_1(a),\ldots, u_1(b),\ldots, b_1(a,b),\ldots\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> are unary and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> are binary relations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Perhaps I need to learn about databases.</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the closed-world assumption?</li>
</ul>
<p>Wait, you aren’t flipping nodes! I thought of the nodes as the actors, and unary functions on them. But are the nodes supposed to be formulae? Like <span class="math inline">\(u_1(x)\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(b_1(x,y)\)</span>, and everything not in it is false?</p>
<p>An atom is not a node but predicates applied to nodes!</p>
<p>(Note the logical contradictions is not on the level of node values, but on the formulas relating them? Don’t have <span class="math inline">\(A\wedge B\)</span> as nodes, only have <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>.) Atoms are formulas without connectives like <span class="math inline">\(\wedge, \implies,\forall...\)</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p>basic inference problem in first-order logic is to determine whether a knowledge base KB entails a formula F, i.e., if F is true in all worlds where KB is true</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sparsity in the sense that only the relations in the database can be true; everything else has to be false?</p>
<p>Also, I don’t understand how to deal with intermediate functions like <span class="math inline">\(f(x,g(y))\)</span>. It seems there’s too many possible values of <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span>!</p>
<p>Approaches to get past intractability:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>pseudo-likelihood</strong> is <span class="math inline">\(\ln \Pj_w^*(X=x) = \sumo ln \log \Pj_w(X_l=x_l|MB_x(X_l))\)</span> (markov blanket). (When is this a good approx?)</li>
<li><strong>Discriminative weight learning</strong>. Partition into evidence and query atoms and calculate conditional log-likelihood. (cf. RBM)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="structure-learning-how-do-we-even-find-the-formulae">6.3 Structure learning: how do we even find the formulae?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Inductive logic programming #lookup. But use evaluation function based on pseudo-likelihood rather than accuracy and coverage.</li>
</ul>
<p>19 Dependencies are really probabilistic. Ex. two titles sharing a word are more likely to be the same?</p>
<p>Applications.</p>
<ul>
<li>Entity resolution (when do things refer to the same object? Include formulae like transitivity of equality.)</li>
<li>Citation resolution. (Ex. which article corresponds to which citation, when are they the same? You can imagine there’s some general rules which would do well.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Lifted inference, lifted resolution in FOL #lookup</p>
<h2 id="ksj-a-general-stochastic-approach-to-solving-problems-with-hard-and-soft-constraints">[KSJ] A general stochastic approach to solving problems with hard and soft constraints</h2>
<ul>
<li>My understanding of “partitioning”: solve a problem hierarchically: break into smaller pieces, find a list of good solutions of each piece, and then figure out how to combine those solutions.</li>
<li>Q: is there an algorithm agnostic to the encoding in some sense? (Doubtful—probably can embed crypto problems? But what if you only allow the simplest transformations?)</li>
<li>WalkSAT <em>does</em> only flip one variable at a time.</li>
<li>Hard constraints have greater weight than soft constraints.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think people do MCMC in problem-solving. Try to tweak things locally. Sometimes though there’s a larger restructuring—view it as a step in a more abstract space, a more abstract transformation?</p>
<h2 id="scraps">Scraps</h2>
<p>(Patterns you construct are patterns you could have found?)</p>
<p>Goal in learning should be to find the formula with weights which decrease the entropy the most?</p>
<p>SAT refutations corresponding to reasonable mathematical statements have short proofs but not the SAT framework? (Any way to compile down?)</p>
<h2 id="directions">Directions</h2>
<ul>
<li>First, understand the classical results on learning and inference in graphical models.</li>
<li>Understand MCMC and variational inference, and the situations where they have provable guarantees.</li>
<li>Try to formulate the simplest problem where you do have some element of first-order logic (ex. a statement with <span class="math inline">\(\forall\)</span>) and/or some combinatorial complexity.</li>
<li>What’s a test problem in this domain? They give citation resolution. Maybe this is practical but it seems like a rather boring problem!</li>
<li>Understand some ideas from the logic-learning community (inductive logic programming, etc.) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_logic_programming">ILP</a>. Machine learning <span class="math inline">\(\cap\)</span> programming languages???</li>
