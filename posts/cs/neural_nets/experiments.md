#Done

* MNIST basics
* CIFAR-10 basics

#Todo

See [Convnets ideas](/tcs/machine_learning/neural_nets/convnets_ideas.html).

* LSTM: generate text
    * Character by character
	* Word by word, using word embeddings
	* With restrictions
	* With parse trees
* LSTM for algorithms
    * Thresholding
	* Neural net Turing machines
* Rotational invariance, etc.
* Smoothness regularization in convolution kernels
* Get familiar with Tensorboard.
* Visualizing neural nets.
* Sparsification
* Reimplementations
    * Deep-fried convnets
	* Fooling neural nets
	* Deep reinforcement learning with Atari games
* "Train twice and put together": independent ways of doing things (cf. boosting)
* Check claims of suspiciously good performance (ex. learning to execute...)
