#Circuit lower bounds and extractors

* The graph-theoretic argument applied to linear circuits reduces finding hard functions to finding rigid matrices.

We can reduce the rigidity problem to finding extractors for a certain class of a certain type.

Find extractors where
* sources are: uniform over $\fc n2$-dimensional (or $\ep n$) subspaces $V\subeq \F_p^n$ such that $V$ has low-weight (sparse, $n^\ep$) basis. (Actually, we can also consider average sparsity.)
* The extractor is linear $E:\F_p^n\to \F_p^{\fc n4}$.

We know deterministic extractors for affine sources, however, here they have to be linear.

Claim: Let $A$ be such that $O=eA$. Then $A$ is rigid.

*Proof*: $A$ has rank $\ge \fc{3n}4$. Suppose $A=L+S$ where $L$ has $<\fc n4$-rank and $S$ is $s$-sparse. $O=EA=EL+ES$ so $-EL=ES$. However, $-EL$ has low rank and $ES$ has high rank ($\fc n4$) as $E$ is an extractor.

Note it suffices to find a condenser; all we need is that $\dim(\spn_s(E(S,s)))=\fc n4$.

(cf. no $2s$ columns of $E$ are linearly dependent.)

#Rigid matrices

Find a small family of rigid matrices. Ex. if you only require linear randomness, then just wire them up too to get a lower bound.

Gabizon-Raz, Affine extractors: give a family of Vandermonde matrices $(x^{ij})$, $x\in [n^3]$ (?). The hope is to get arithmetic lower bounds. Problem: the degree is too large, so the bounds are trivial. Try to lower the degree.

Best lower bounds for arithmetic circuits: for $x_1^n,\ldots, x_n^n$, get $n\lg n$. Use Bezout: use the highest degree of an algebraic variety made from the polynomials as a complexity measure, need to get to $d^n$, so need $n\ln d$ steps.

Zach Remscrim has a nice recent paper.
