# Threads

## Priority

* Come up with a class of MDPs on exponential space that is interesting and tractable. [Thoughts](/posts/tcs/machine_learning/reinforcement_learning/continuous.html)
	* Understand provable guarantees on MDP's first
* PMI - get some results! 
	* Mon. - train CIFAR.
	* Todos
		* Check MNIST model 1. What are sizes of coefficients?
		* Run experiments on CIFAR.

## Other

* SoS [summary](/posts/tcs/complexity/sos.html) (Monday: wrote up notes.)
* DL experiments [DL generalization](/posts/tcs/machine_learning/matrices/DL_generalization.html)
* On hold
    * (\*) NN learns DL. Can write up weak result, worth doing?
* Papers
	* [HM16] on unsupervised learning (finish)
	* [HMR16] on dynamical system learning

Analyze Arora and Ge's NMF algorithm in the presence of noise. Exactly how much noise can it tolerate? 

# Other papers

* TODO Read this paper: [CFP16] Assessing significance in a Markov chain without mixing

# People to talk to 

* Yingyu, on PMI
