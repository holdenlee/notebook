Goals:

* Run basic PMI experiments
    * [PMI images](/posts/tcs/machine_learning/neural_nets/pmi_images.html), [PMI idea](/posts/tcs/machine_learning/nlp/pmi.html)
	* Get dictionary learning/weighted SVD code from Yingyu.
	* Write up findings.
* Learning
    * Go through half of ATAP.
	* Ch. 4 of HDP.
	* Understand conjugate gradients using Chebyshev polys. Look at AGD from this point of view.
	* Summarize bandit paper.
