# Current projects

* Langevin (Mon)
* EGNN
* NLP: (Mon)
	* BoNGs: make recovery work for $n$-grams, $n\ge 2$.
	* Treegrams
		* cf. Sida Wang
		* hyperdim vectors
	* document embedding (axioms?) 
	* GANs for BoNGs
* Long-term memory (COLT open problem) (Tue)
	* For convex optimization
	* Tue: this seems difficult because of "bottleneck" of probability $\ll \rc{\poly(n)}$. Next step: familiarize with lower-bound techniques and try to prove lower bound.
* Reinforcement learning (experiments - what to do?)

# Reading

* [Do GANs learn?](https://workflowy.com/#/cc7e392e4fff)
* [Representation learning](../tcs/machine_learning/representation/AR17.md)
* BONGs
* Hyperparameter tuning

# Explorations

* Further on temperature varying and Langevin
	* RAISE estimator - similar criterion?
		* "Multiplicative" weights
	* Other settings where annealing helps. Analogue on Boolean cube.
	* Tensor decomposition. 
		* Beyond the homotopy method.
		* [MR16]
* Co-training - predict one part from other. Relating to/extending CCA.
* RL - kernel?
