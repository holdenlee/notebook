# Threads

* PMI - get some results!
* SoS - chapters 2 and 3
* DL: do experiments suggested in [DL generalization](/posts/tcs/machine_learning/matrices/DL_generalization.html) (Mon, Tue)
    * (\*) NN learns DL. (Mon, Tue) - Wrote up progress so far, where I am stuck.
* Papers
	* [HM16] on unsupervised learning (went through 1st half, Tue)
	* [HMR16] on dynamical system learning (read [blog post](http://www.offconvex.org/2016/10/13/gradient-descent-learns-dynamical-systems/) Tue)
* Come up with a class of MDPs on exponential space that is interesting and tractable. [Thoughts](/posts/tcs/machine_learning/reinforcement_learning/exponential.html)
	* Understand provable guarantees on MDP's first
* Alexa [references](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OtvefjviKSSWH2gzOtYo8T_DVEwPEsI2n0kdrC8WlZI/edit)

Analyze Arora and Ge's NMF algorithm in the presence of noise. Exactly how much noise can it tolerate? 

# Other papers

* TODO Read this paper: [CFP16] Assessing significance in a Markov chain without mixing

# Talk with Arora 10/19 (Wed)
