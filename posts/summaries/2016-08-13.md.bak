Goals:

* Run basic PMI experiments
    * [PMI images](/posts/tcs/machine_learning/neural_nets/pmi_images.html), [PMI idea](/posts/tcs/machine_learning/nlp/pmi.html)
	* Get dictionary learning/weighted SVD code from Yingyu.
	* Write up findings.
* Learning
    * Go through half of ATAP.
	* Ch. 4 of HDP.
	* Understand conjugate gradients using Chebyshev polys. Look at AGD from this point of view.
	* Summarize bandit paper.
* Representation learning
    * Clarify idea.
* Tensorflow
    * Get basic LSTM running.
	* Play with parameters in MNIST.

Summary:

* Got PMI code running.
* [Approximation theory and approximation practice](/posts/math/analysis/numerical/ATAP.html): Notes
    * Understood conjugate gradient bound using Chebyshev polynomials (@Cyril). [Notes](/posts/math/analysis/numerical/chebyshev.html)
* Talk: Yuanzhi on Bandit convex optimization (FOLLOW UP)
* Representation learning [summary](/posts/tcs/machine_learning/representation.html). Talked to Yingyu and kernel DL.
* Read [BH16](/posts/tcs/machine_learning/matrices/BH16.html).
