# Summary

* Neural net learns dictionaries: run experiments. I found nothing unexpected: closeby initialization does converge. The farther away, the farther away the final $A$ is. (But I think it should be a `_/` shape---where is the cusp?)
	* Are the different dictionaries related by a linear transformation? It seems not.
* Simons meeting---spanning trees, bandit convex optimization.
	* Can we use kernel methods for MDP's?
* Meeting with Arora
	* Learn about continuous HMM models.
	* Improve NLP.
