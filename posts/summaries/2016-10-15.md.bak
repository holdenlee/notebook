Analyze Arora and Ge's NMF algorithm in the presence of noise. Exactly how much noise can it tolerate? 

* TODO Read this paper: [CFP16] Assessing significance in a Markov chain without mixing

# Talk with Arora 10/13 (Thu)

* DL experiments
	* Convergence by initializing with samples?
	* Convergence with backprop?
	* - @Tengyu
* NNDL
* PMI - fix training problem, @Yingyu for advice on code
* Explaining backprop, the Network chin rule $\pd fv = \sum_i \pd f{y_i} \pd{y_i}v$. 
* Come up with a class of MDPs on exponential space that is interesting and tractable. [Thoughts](/posts/tcs/machine_learning/reinforcement_learning/exponential.html)

# Other 

* [Finite model theory](/posts/math/logic/finite_model_theory.html) (Thu)

"correct initial state that generated $y_t$"
Evolution is deterministic!
