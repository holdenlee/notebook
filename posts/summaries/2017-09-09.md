# Current projects

* Reinforcement learning
	* LQR
	* Experiments
	* Kernel
* Next steps with sampling problems, temperature-varying
	* Understand AIS/RAISE
	* AIS/RAISE estimator - similar criterion?
		* See [BGS14] Accurate and Conservative Estimates of MRF Log-likelihood using Reverse Annealing
		* "Multiplicative" weights
	* Other settings where annealing helps. Analogue on Boolean cube.
	* Tensor decomposition. 
		* Beyond the homotopy method.
		* [MR16]
* EGNN
* NLP: 
	* BoNGs: make recovery work for $n$-grams, $n\ge 2$.
	* Treegrams
		* cf. Sida Wang
		* hyperdim vectors
	* document embedding (axioms?) 

# Sidelined 

* Long-term memory (COLT open problem) (Tue)
	* For convex optimization
	* Tue: this seems difficult because of "bottleneck" of probability $\ll \rc{\poly(n)}$. Next step: familiarize with lower-bound techniques and try to prove lower bound.
	
# Logic learning (with Kiran)

* Coming up with the objective
	* Ex. restrict to separable $\sum w_i f_i$.
* Learn representations with desired properties by human feedback
* IRL, CIRL. Learn human references, loss function.
* Picking out part of image that matters
* Graphs?
* Recovery as good property to have?
* Learn logic/PCFG over curriculum without supervised data. Language generation.
* Readings (Hrishikesh)
	* Probabilistic sentential decision diagrams
		* [KVCD14] PSSD
		* [D11] SDD
		* [N86] Probabilistic logic
	* Markov random fields
	* Fuzzy logic
	* Continuous representations of boolean functions
	* Neural tensor machines (matrix product)
* Learning language games through interaction
	* [Naturalizing PL](https://worksheets.codalab.org/worksheets/0xbf8f4f5b42e54eba9921f7654b3c5c5d/)
	* [Blocks grammar](https://github.com/holdenlee/Blocks)
* Learning grammar: see messenger.
	* [TH] Unsupervised learning of probabilistic context-free grammar using iterative biclustering
	* [CTC] Automatic Learning of Context-Free Grammar
	
# AISFP preparation

* Write up AI safety thoughts (from books, etc.)
* Review:
	* Lob's theorem
	* Decision theories
