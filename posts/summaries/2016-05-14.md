Machine learning

* Presentation on Language Games
    * TODO: Find some theoretical problems.
* NMF
    * Why can we use the regular pseudoinverse? (CONTINUE)
	* TODO: Search literature, talk to Andrej, Tengyu for ideas
	* TODO: Look at Freddy's code and do some experiments.
* NLP learning
    * Read Mike Collins's notes
    * Skimmed [CC14] on NMF.
	* TODO: Read book on NLP.
* [Streaming PCA, Yuanzhi Li](../tcs/machine_learning/matrices/streaming_PCA.html).
* TODO: Finish reviewing rest of BV
* TODO: Read lots, start keeping track of problems and techniques.

<!--After NIPS, find collaborations with other ML students.-->

Coding

* Understood SoS relaxation approach.
* Started reading CSP refutation paper.
    * TODO: Read more of it, in particular, understand how to convert it to SoS language.
* Tried "covering with convex sets" but seems difficult.
* TODO: try approach with modulus of convexity.
* TODO: understand SDP extension approach.
* TODO: other approaches?

TCS

* Log-sobolev inequalities

TODO

* Review statistical physics.
* Review metric embeddings/geometric inequalities (MAT529) (@Kiran).
* Things left to summarize:
    * Convex geometry
	* Optimization (BV)
	* Optimization on manifolds (AMS)
* Make a summer reading list. (@Arora)
    * General TCS (randomized algorithms, approximation algorithms)
	* Probability (finish)
	* Advanced probability
	    * ? Martingales
	    * Concentration inequalities
		* Stochastic processes
		* Random matrices
	* Amit Singer's course
	* Optimization (@Hazan for recommendations.)
	* ? ATaAP
	* Topics
