[Last week](2016-10-22.html). (See wonderings there.)

# Threads

## Priority

* Come up with a class of MDPs on exponential space that is interesting and tractable. [Thoughts](/posts/tcs/machine_learning/reinforcement_learning/continuous.html)
	* Understand provable guarantees on MDP's first
* Alexa [references](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OtvefjviKSSWH2gzOtYo8T_DVEwPEsI2n0kdrC8WlZI/edit) (Wed-Fri)

## Other

* PMI - get some results! 
	* Mon. - train CIFAR.
	* Todos
		* Check MNIST model 1. What are sizes of coefficients?
		* Run experiments on CIFAR.
* SoS - chapters 2--5
* DL experiments [DL generalization](/posts/tcs/machine_learning/matrices/DL_generalization.html)
* On hold
    * (\*) NN learns DL. Can write up weak result, worth doing?
* Papers
	* [HM16] on unsupervised learning (finish)
	* [HMR16] on dynamical system learning

Analyze Arora and Ge's NMF algorithm in the presence of noise. Exactly how much noise can it tolerate? 

# Other papers
