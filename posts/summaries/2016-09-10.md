Continue from [last week](2016-09-03.html).

* Work out optimality conditions for 2-layer net for DL.

(Threshold PMI's first?)

# Conversation with Arora

* PMI experiments
    * Is PMI the right measure? Are the feature vectors close to sparse? if the average image there is $>20\%$ activation, then no.
	* Look for discriminative features, those that occur with one label and rarely for others.
	* Do SVM coefficients have negative weights?
* Things to read
    * [HRS16] Train faster, generalize better: stability of stochastic gradient descent [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.01240v2). See also blog post.
	* Teacher-training net
