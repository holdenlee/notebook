Things I'm confused about. 

* I'm uncomfortable with theorems in the meta-logic. How do you define the meta-logic without infinite recursion (meta-meta, etc.)? Godel incompleteness, etc. are NOT theorems in the logic, but the meta-logic---if you want them as theorems in the logic then you have to define the logic inside the logic---there's no reflection, right? Because that would be $\square A to A$.
* What did I mean by reflection?
* Nesting is unsatisfactory...
* Is $PA\vdash A\implies PA\vdash B \iff PA\vdash \square A \to \square B$ a theorem in the meta-logic? 
* Is $PA\vdash \square A\implies PA\vdash A$ a theorem in the meta-logic? An axiom?
* How do you define "truth" in the meta-logic?
* Is $\square \square A \to \square A$ a theorem?
* Is $PA\vdash \square A \to \square B, PA\vdash A \implies PA\vdash B$? How about $PA\vdash \square (\square A \to \square B)\wedge \square A \to \square B$?
* Can you add quantifiers? Is it true that $\forall x, \square P(x) \imples \square \forall x, P(x)$? My guess is not (at least, it can't be proved). Should $\square$ be Bew here? I think you're not allowed to use $\square$ here, but that's ok, you can state it with Bew. $\square$ is interpreted as $Bew(\ce{})$ in PA, right?
* Is $(\square A \to \square B) \to \square (A\to B)$ a theorem?
