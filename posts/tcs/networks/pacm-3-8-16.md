This work studies stochastic diffusion model where influence propagates in networks from seed-nodes along edges with independent probabilities. Specifically, we propose spectral bounds for the expected number of nodes that are influenced at the end of propagation. The proposed bounds show significant improvements over the existing bounds in the presence of sensitive edges such as bottlenecks, seed adjacent, and high probability edges.
