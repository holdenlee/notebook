#Talk with Zeev

Consider a partition of the complete bipartite graph into matchings. What is the worst partition, in the sense that you have to take the union of many ($\Om(\ln n)$) matchings before you get an expander in the sense of the Expander Mixing Lemma?

Now consider if the bipartite graph represents a Cayley graph ($x$ on the left is connected to $gx$ on the right). "Abelian groups are the worst expanders."

If you need $\ge d$ matchings, you get a LDC from $d$ to $n$. 

Consider tripartite hypergraphs, with $n^3$ matchings partitioned into $n^2$. Is the worst partition take $(\ln n)^2$?
