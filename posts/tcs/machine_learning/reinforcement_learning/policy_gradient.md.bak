[SASM00] Policy gradient methods for RL with function approximation

A version of policy iteration with arbitrary differentiable function converges to a locally optimal policy.

Problems with the value-function approach

* finds deterministic policies.
* a small change in estimated vaue of action can change the action selected. (obstacles for convergence guarantees)

$$\De \te \approx \al \pdd{\rh}{\te}.$$
