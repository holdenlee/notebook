From [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transduction_(machine_learning))

> In logic, statistical inference, and supervised learning, transduction or transductive inference is reasoning from observed, specific (training) cases to specific (test) cases. In contrast, induction is reasoning from observed training cases to general rules, which are then applied to the test cases. The distinction is most interesting in cases where the predictions of the transductive model are not achievable by any inductive model.  Note that this is caused by transductive inference on different test sets producing mutually inconsistent predictions.

Ex. Semi-supervised clustering
