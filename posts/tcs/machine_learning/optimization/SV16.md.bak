Problem: sample a point from the uniform distribution in a polytope $K\subeq \R^n$. (This is used in many algorithms.)

Main theorem (informal): From a warm start (i.e., density $\Pj(A)\le C\Pj_{U_K}(A)$ where $U_K$ is the uniform distribution on $K$), the Dikin walk mixes in time $O(mn)$ for a $n$-dimensional polytope described with $m$ inequalities.

# Dikin walk

For $K$ defined by $a_i^Tx\ge b$, let
\begin{align}
F(x) :&= -\sum_{i\in [m]} \ln (a_i^Tx-b_i)\\
H(x) = \nb^2F(x) &= \sum_{i\in [m]} \rc{(a_i^Tx-b_i)^2}a_ia_i^T\\
\ve{v}_x^2 :&= v^TH(x)v\\
\text{Dikin ellipsoid }\mathcal E_x:&=\set{z}{\ve{z-x}_x\le 1}.
\end{align}

Consider the random variable $g_x$ given by 
$$ z = x + \fc{r}{\sqrt n} H(x)^{-\rc 2}g,\quad g\sim N(0,1),$$
i.e. it is a Gaussian with covariance matrix $\fc{r^2}{n}H(x)^{-1}$ centered at $x$.

Let $p_x$ be the $g_x$ with the Metropolis filter applied, 
$$ p_x(z) = \min\{g_x(z),g_z(x)\}$$
(stay at $x$ with remaining probability).

# Theorem and Proof

Define the cross-ratio distance $$\si(x,y) = \fc{|\ol{xy}||\ol{pq}|}{|\ol{px}||\ol{qy}|},$$
where $xy$ hits the boundary of $K$ at $p,q$ ($pxyq$ are in that order). $\ln (1+\si(x,y))$ is a metric on $K$.

**Theorem 1**: Given a reversible random walk in $K$ with stationary distribution uniform, suppose $\exists \De>0$ such that for all $x,y\in K$ with $\si(x,y)\le \De$, $\ve{p_x-p_y}_1\le 1-\Om(1)$. Then after $O(\De^{-2})$, the lazy version of the walk from a warm start is within $\rc4$ TV distance from the uniform distribution.

(This is saying something about uniform continuity of $x\mapsto p_x$. There's a "smoothing out" effect.)

Proof of main theorem.

1. **Theorem 2**: For the Gaussian Dikin walk with $r\le \fc{\ep}{400}\pa{\ln \pf{200}{\ep}}^{-\fc 32}$, for $x,y\in K$ with $\ve{x-y}_x\le \fc{r}{\sqrt n}$, $\ve{p_x-p_y}\le \ep$.
    * **Lemma 3**: Let $r\le 1, c\ge 0, c\le \min\{r,\rc 3\}$, $x,y\in K$. If $\ve{x-y}_x\le \fc{c}{\sqrt n}$, then $\ve{g_x-g_y}_1\le 3c$. (Proof: KL divergence between Gaussians, Pinsker's inequality.)
	* **Lemma 4**: Given $\ep\in [0,\rc 2]$, for $r\le \fc{\ep}{100}(\ln \fc{50}{\ep})^{-\fc 32}$, we have $\ve{p_x-g_x}_1\le \ep$. (Proof: Hypercontractivity)
	* Use triangle inequality.
2. For any polytope $K$ described using $m$ inequalities, $\si(x,y) \ge \rc{\sqrt m}\ve{x-y}_x$.
3. Use Theorem 1. $\si(x,y)\le \De$ implies $\ve{x-y}_x\le De\sqrt m$. Take $\De =O\prc{\sqrt{mn}}$.
