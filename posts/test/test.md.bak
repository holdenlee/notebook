Math equations.

$1\in \R, \infty\nin \R$

This is math:

$$ \int_1^x \fc{1}{u}\,du = \ln x.$$

More math:

$$
\pi = 4\sum_{n=0}^{\iy} (-1)^n \fc{1}{2n+1}
$$

\begin{align}
\label{eq:1}
\rc{2} &= \fc 24\\
&=\fc 48
\end{align}

Equation $\eqref{eq:1}$ above.

$$
\sA \Pj  \mfp \matt 1001

Things that don't work:

* `\mathbbm{1}`
